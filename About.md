#Thanks!
I am glad you are reading this. This is basically how I learn. I find these tutorials or source codes read and study them, and since I am 
a supporter of open source community, I have this project. The BeffsBrowser is actually my other project, I added labs so that I can use that 
name with a extra word that showed it was a side project. Currently BeffsBrowser is under a long update that may take a few months to complete
Stay tuned!
